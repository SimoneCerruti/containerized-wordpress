# Changelog

## Versioning policy

This repo follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):
`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`. Each release is a git tag (`vX.Y.Z`) on `main`
matching the contents of [VERSION](VERSION).

### What constitutes a change

- **MAJOR (X.0.0)** — breaking change to the consumer contract.
  Consumers must update their project alongside the base bump.
  Examples:
  - A drop-in directory is renamed or removed
    (e.g. `overrides/configs/nginx.d/` → `overrides/configs/http.d/`).
  - An environment variable previously consumed by a base script is
    removed or its meaning changes.
  - A bundled script's CLI or expected inputs change.
  - `compose.base.yml` changes service name, removes a volume mount, or
    changes an `include:`-facing path in a way that breaks existing
    project compose files.
  - Required base image bump that changes PHP/WP major version.

- **MINOR (1.X.0)** — additive, backward-compatible.
  Examples:
  - New drop-in directory added to `apply-overrides.sh`.
  - New optional env var with a safe default.
  - New script bundled in `scripts/`.
  - New default security header in `configs/nginx.conf` that doesn't
    break existing sites.

- **PATCH (1.0.X)** — bug fix or internal cleanup.
  Examples:
  - Fix a typo or regex bug in `wp-malware-scan.sh`.
  - Tighten file permissions on a drop-in destination.
  - Update Cloudflare IP fetch URL.

### Upgrade procedure

For each registered project on a host:

1. **Stage first.** Bump one project (ideally a staging clone) before
   rolling out broadly:
   ```bash
   wpbase update /srv/projects/staging-site --version 1.X.Y --build
   ```
2. **Verify health.** Confirm the container reports healthy and the
   site responds:
   ```bash
   docker compose -f /srv/projects/staging-site/docker-compose.yml ps
   curl -sf https://staging.example.com/robots.txt
   ```
3. **Check logs for regressions.**
   ```bash
   docker compose -f /srv/projects/staging-site/docker-compose.yml \
     exec wp tail -n 200 /var/log/wp_app/{nginx.error,php-fpm,apply-overrides}.log
   ```
4. **Roll out.** Once staging is clean:
   ```bash
   wpbase update-all --version 1.X.Y --yes --build
   ```
5. **Read the entry for this version below** before bumping a MAJOR —
   it lists every breaking change and the migration step required.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-05-29

### Added
- `configs/crontab`: the base now schedules the two standard WordPress jobs
  out of the box, so projects no longer need to add them in
  `overrides/configs/crontab.d/`:
  - **wp-cron loopback** — `*/5 * * * * www-data /usr/local/bin/wp-cron.sh`.
  - **wp-malware-scan** — `17 3 * * * www-data . /etc/cron.d/container-env &&
    /usr/local/bin/wp-malware-scan.sh`. The job sources the env snapshot
    written by `entrypoint.sh` so `WP_PATH` + `MALWARE_SCAN_*` are visible;
    if `MALWARE_SCAN_NOTIFY_EMAIL` is unset the scan logs an error and
    exits 0 (effective no-op until configured).
  `overrides/configs/crontab.d/` is now reserved for **custom** per-project
  jobs only. Existing projects can drop their wp-cron / malware-scan
  drop-ins after the bump; if they don't, cron simply runs each twice — no
  breakage, just duplicate invocations.
- `wp-cron.sh`: switched from the curl HTTP loopback (`/wp-cron.php`) to a
  direct `wp cron event run --due-now` call under the CLI SAPI, guarded by
  `flock -n /tmp/wp-cron.lock`. Two real improvements: long-running events
  (WooCommerce Action Scheduler, etc.) are no longer killed by the 55s
  HTTP/php-fpm timeout, and concurrent ticks are detected and skipped
  instead of piling up. Trade-off worth knowing: WP-CLI runs cron callbacks
  without an HTTP request, so plugins that strictly require `$_SERVER
  ['HTTP_HOST']`, nginx-set headers, or a populated `$_REQUEST` may behave
  differently — most plugins are unaffected. Restore the previous behavior
  on a single project by shipping `overrides/scripts/wp-cron.sh` with the
  curl call. The script's CLI and expected inputs are unchanged, so this
  stays in the MINOR (additive) lane.
- `Dockerfile.base`: interactive-shell ergonomics — `alias ls='ls -lah
  --color=auto'` and a `wp()` wrapper that drops `PHP Deprecated/Notice/
  Warning` lines from stderr. Cron and non-interactive scripts are
  unaffected (bashrc is only sourced in interactive shells), so this
  doesn't change any cron behavior.

### Fixed
- `cloudflare-ips.sh`: tolerate Cloudflare fetch failures without
  clobbering an existing config. v4/v6 ranges are fetched into variables
  first; if either is empty AND a previous
  `/etc/nginx/conf.d/cloudflare-ips.conf` exists, the old file is kept. If
  no previous file exists, a valid config is still written with the static
  Docker network entries — degraded but loadable. Validation (`nginx -t`)
  is decoupled from reload (`nginx -s reload`): validation must pass, but
  a failed reload is treated as expected when nginx isn't running yet
  (build time, first boot). The bootstrap path in `Dockerfile.base` no
  longer needs its stub fallback in practice.
- `configs/nginx.conf`: the Cloudflare include is now a glob
  (`cloudflare-ips*.conf`) so nginx tolerates the file being absent
  entirely and supports splitting into multiple files later.
- `entrypoint.sh`: harden the cron env snapshot. Names are sourced from
  `compgen -v` + indirect expansion (`${!name}`) instead of parsing
  `printenv` with `IFS='='` (which split incorrectly when a value
  contained `=` or a stray newline). Explicitly skips
  `WORDPRESS_CONFIG_EXTRA` (multi-line PHP for wp-config.php injection —
  unneeded by cron and bloats the sourced env).

### Docs
- `CLAUDE.md`: **Conventional Commits v1.0.0 is now mandatory** for every
  commit message in this repo. Subject is
  `<type>[optional scope][!]: <description>`; allowed types are listed
  (feat, fix, docs, refactor, perf, test, build, ci, chore, revert) along
  with common scopes (`crontab`, `entrypoint`, `cloudflare-ips`,
  `wp-cron`, `wp-malware-scan`, `nginx`, `compose`, `image`, `docs`,
  `release`). The `!` / `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer is explicitly tied to
  the consumer-contract breakage definition that drives MAJOR releases in
  this CHANGELOG.
- `CLAUDE.md` gotcha #2: updated to reflect that the base crontab now
  ships wp-cron + wp-malware-scan.
- `SCRIPTS.md`: `wp-cron.sh` / `wp-malware-scan.sh` "Runs" sections
  updated; `wp-cron.sh` "Does"/"Reads env"/"Logs to" rewritten for the new
  WP-CLI approach, with the CLI-SAPI trade-off called out explicitly.

## [1.0.3] - 2026-05-27

### Fixed
- `entrypoint.sh`: the cron env snapshot written to `/etc/cron.d/container-env`
  now emits each value with `printf %q` (and `export`) instead of a raw
  `printenv | grep` dump of `KEY=VAL`. The old form broke `source`-ing the file
  whenever a value contained spaces, `$`, quotes, backticks or other shell
  metacharacters (and could even execute embedded commands); cron jobs that
  source it — e.g. for `WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD` — now get the values intact.
  Affects the baked-in script, so it ships in the image.

## [1.0.2] - 2026-05-26

### Changed
- `.env.wordpress.example`: add an explicit `WORDPRESS_DEBUG=0` (the image's
  master switch for `WP_DEBUG`) and correct the surrounding comment — the
  existing `WP_DEBUG_LOG` / `WP_DEBUG_DISPLAY` lines only take effect when
  `WORDPRESS_DEBUG=1`. No runtime change (debug was already off by default);
  flip to `1` for silent error logging to `wp-content/debug.log`. Template-only.
- `wp-malware-scan.sh`: the scan report email is now **English** (was Italian).
  Project convention is now English everywhere, including user-facing output
  (CLAUDE.md updated). Affects the baked-in script, so it ships in the image.

### Fixed
- **Corrected the Docker Compose minimum to v5.1+** (docs said v2.24+). The
  project's `docker-compose.yml` redefines the `wp` service it imports via
  `include:`; Compose only merges an overridden imported service from v5.1+ —
  v2.x (verified on v2.39.2) errors with `services.wp conflicts with imported
  resource`. `wpbase`'s `require_compose_version` preflight bumped to v5.1
  accordingly (separate repo). Install on hosts with
  `apt-get install docker-compose-plugin`.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-05-26

Template-only changes (PATCH). These touch the starter files scaffolded into
the project root on `wpbase install` — `base/` and the image are unchanged.
Existing projects keep their own `docker-compose.yml`/`.env*`; only **new**
installs pick these up.

### Changed
- `compose.example.yml`: default `certresolver` → `cloudflare`; added a
  `www → non-www` redirect router + middleware (with a commented
  `non-www → www` alternative); publish the `db` port on the host loopback
  (`127.0.0.1:${DB_FORWARD_PORT}:3306`); explicit `.service` on the redirect
  router; explicit `driver: bridge` on the `default` network.
- `.env.example`: renamed `DB_PORT` → `DB_FORWARD_PORT` with a comment — it is
  the host-side published port only (loopback), unrelated to the in-container
  `db:3306` connection; vary it when one host runs several MariaDB containers.
- `.env.wordpress.example`: `WORDPRESS_DB_HOST` hardcoded to `db:3306`,
  decoupling the WP→db connection from the host-forward port.

## [1.0.0] - Initial release

### Image & stack
- WordPress 7 / PHP 8.5-fpm base image.
- Nginx + supervisor + cron + logrotate under a single supervisord PID.
- Cloudflare real IP refresh (weekly cron + boot).
- WP malware scan (nightly). All scan-specific env vars are prefixed
  `MALWARE_SCAN_` (`MALWARE_SCAN_NOTIFY_EMAIL`, `MALWARE_SCAN_PATH_EXCLUDES`,
  `MALWARE_SCAN_WHITELIST`, `MALWARE_SCAN_STATE_DIR`, `MALWARE_SCAN_ADMIN_DAYS`,
  `MALWARE_SCAN_LOG_FILE`).

### Override mechanism (per-project customization)
- `overrides/configs/nginx.d/*.conf` → nginx `http {}`-level snippets.
- `overrides/configs/server.d/*.conf` → nginx `server {}`-level snippets,
  included at the **end** of the server block. For **adding** `location`
  blocks and server-level directives; cannot redefine directives/locations
  already set in the base (see CLAUDE.md gotcha #1).
- `overrides/configs/php.ini.d/*.ini` → php.ini drop-ins.
- `overrides/configs/crontab.d/*` → cron jobs.
- `overrides/configs/supervisor.d/*.conf` → extra supervisor programs.
- `overrides/scripts/*.sh` → custom scripts.
- `overrides/scripts/post-entrypoint.sh` → optional boot hook.

### Compose & config delivery
- `compose.base.yml` — versioned `wp` service shape (build args, healthcheck,
  named volumes, `env_file`), `include:`d by the project's
  `docker-compose.yml`. Requires Docker Compose v2.24+ (`project_directory:`).
- `compose.example.yml`, `.env.example`, `.env.wordpress.example` — starter
  templates copied into the project root on first setup (never into `base/`).

### Tooling & release plumbing
- `release.yml` verifies `VERSION` == pushed tag and publishes the GitHub
  Release. `.githooks/pre-push` enforces the same check locally (opt-in via
  `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`).
- `.dockerignore` keeps the standalone build context minimal.
- `base/` extraction contract for `wpbase-cli`: it must extract
  `compose.base.yml` in addition to `Dockerfile.base`, `VERSION`, `configs/`,
  and `scripts/`. (The full layout + change brief are maintained as
  gitignored, local-only handoff docs for the wpbase-cli maintainer.)
